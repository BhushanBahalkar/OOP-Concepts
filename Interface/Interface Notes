Title: Interface in Java

An interface is a reference type that acts as a blueprint for class.
It defines a set of methods and constant variables.

Interface provide a way to achieve abstraction focusing on what a class should do rather than how it does it.

Interfaces could only have abstract methods, and public static and final variables by default.

It implies Is-A relationship, Which means that a subclass is specific type of its superclass.

e.g : consider a class hierarchy with a superclass called "Animal" and a subclass called "Dog." 
      We can say that a Dog is an Animal, which reflects the is-a relationship.

In java, the abstract keyword applies only to classes and methods indicating that they can not be instantiated directly and must be implemented .
