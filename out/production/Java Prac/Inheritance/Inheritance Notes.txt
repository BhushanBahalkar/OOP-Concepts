Topic: Inheritance

When an object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object is known as inheritance.
Inheritance provides code reusability.
It represents parent-child relationship.
We can use (extends) keyword to inherit the properties of the other classes.
however, multiple inheritance is not possible in java, to reduce the complexity and simplify the language, but to achieve that task we have (Interfaces) to 
do the task.


Types of Inheritance:

1. Single level inheritance: In this type of inheritance, only two classes are there base class &
one is derived class.

2. Multi-level inheritance: In this type of inheritance derived class becomes base for another class,
then, multi-level inheritance occurs.It is like a chain of inheritances.

3. Hierarchical inheritance: Here two or more classes inherit a single class.


In industry there are many aspects where inheritance is used to develop the particular software,
here are some examples: GUI(Graphical User Interfaces),Game Development, Financial Software's,
Web development, Automotive software's and E-commers platforms, etc.

In each example, Inheritance promotes code reuse, code reduce and redundancy and make codebase
more maintainable.
